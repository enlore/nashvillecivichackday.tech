        <h3>Interested in Sponsoring Us?</h3>
        <p>Sponsoring a civic hackathon is a great way to connect with grassroots communities of talented people and to take part in making our city a better place to live.</p>
        <p>While the hackathon is an all volunteer effort, we recognize and appreciate that sponsorship makes that effort smoother and easier. If you or your company would like to chip in, send us an email. We'd love to talk about it.</p>

    <section id="faq">
        <h2>FAQ</h2>
        <h3>Not a coder?</h3>
        <p>Excellent! We want to invite people from all kinds of professions and backgrounds. Good software projects need more than coders. They need designers, content makers, domain experts, organizers and managers, testers, researchers, and more.</p>
        <p>Even if software is a totally foreign language to you, we'll do our best find a place for you and help you get involved. Come help us make good things!</p>
        <h3>Never been to a hackathon?</h3>
        <p>Great! We'd love to have you. If you're unfamiliar with the format, a hackathon is a day long (or two), intensive learning and building session often organized around a theme, like ours, transparency and feedback in government.</p>
        <p>Our hackathon is constructed with a fun, cooperative atmosphere, so if you aren't an expert coder or you're just starting to learn design you'll be just as welcome as a twenty year veteran of the scene.</p>
        <p>Check out this article on Medium for an introduction to hackathons.</p>
        <h3>Code of Conduct</h3>
        <p>We take making the Nashville Civic Hack Day a safe place for people to get together very seriously. Please <a href="#">read our code of conduct</a>, and don't hesitate to contact us if you have questions, concerns, or experience any uncivilized behavior during the event.</p>
        <h3>Accessibility</h3>
