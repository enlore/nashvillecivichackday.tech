        h5 Interested In Sponsors Us?

        p.
          Sponsoring a civic hackathon is a great way to connect with grass roots
          communities of talented people, and to take part in making our city a
          better place to live.

        p.
          While the hackathon is an all volunteer effort, we recognize and appreciate
          that sponsorship makes that effort smoother and easier. If you or your
          company would like to chip in, send us an email. We'd love to talk about it.
